# Arbourview Bed and Breakfast

[Website: ](http://credowebdev.com/avbnb/)

Built with Codeigniter/PHP and MySQL, this site is responsive and has an admin panel which allows for editing of the main text of the home page and images displayed on the Gallery page. The gallery admin function utilizes AJAX to update image information and a MySQL stored procedure to allow for effortless reordering of the photos. Uploaded images are watermarked and resized as necessary. The Reservation page sends a reservation request confirmation to the customer and an email notifying the B&B operator of the request. The reservation calendar was custom built with JavaScript/Jquery. 

To [test the admin functions: ](http://credowebdev.com/avbnb/admin). The username and password are guest and credo password (with the space). I only ask that you do not delete what is already there.
