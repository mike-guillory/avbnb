				hesitate to recommend this B &#38 B to anyone.&#34;

				&#34;My wife and I stayed at Arborview for three nights in late May 2014. We had a great experience. 
				Brian Dorsey was a wonderful host. He lent us his Garmin GPS device during our visit. It turned out 
				to be invaluable, as I navigated the highways of St. Catherines and environs, taking my wife to the 
				conference she was attending at Brock University, and searching out local wineries and restaurants. 
				He does this regularly with guests. Dorsey is a former member of the city council and school board 
				of St. Catherines, and a knowledgeable source of information about the city and the region. The house 
				was built in the 1950s, and is sited in a very quiet residential area. The generous breakfasts kept us 
				going for much of the day.&#34;

				&#34;We just spent two nights at Arbourview B&#38B. Brian was a wonderful host. His home is immaculate and 
				he went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed. Just tell him what you want for breakfast 
				and he'll be most accommodating. We really enjoyed our chats with him - he is a very interesting person 
				with such a varied background - even being a city councilor for St.Catharines.He has completely renovated 
				the home himself and everything is tastefully done. The price of this B&#38B was great. We were visiting 
				Niagara on the Lake but avoided the extra expense by staying a little further out in St.Catharines. We 
				would certainly recommend Brian's B&#38B. Thanks for everything Brian!&#34;

				&#34;This was a new experience for my wife and I to stay at a Bed &#38 Breakfast. After reviewing several we 
				decided to stay at Arbour B&#38B. For us this was a wonderful experience. Our Host Brian Dorsey we found to be 
				such a wonderful Host, a great cook, and a very interesting man to talk with. The home is adorned with many 
				antiques all of which have been refinished and upholstered by Brian. If the need arises we would be happy to

				&#34;my wife and I stayed here while biking one weekend. Brian promptly welcomed us and showed us our room. He 
				pointed us in the right direction and made some recommendations for dinner down town. The bed was comfortable, 
				the place was quiet, Brian was more than happy to adjust the temperature in the house for us. We told him what 
				time we were getting up and he had a wonderful breakfast ready for us. No complaints here, if you're looking for 
				something fancy, go somewhere else. If you're looking for a place kinda like home with a quiet atmosphere and 
				great breakfast, check out arbour-view. PS-bring your own alarm...&#34;

				&#34;We had a great stay at the Arbour View B&#38B! We biked the Greater Niagara Circle Route starting in 
				Fort Erie and this B&#38B was exactly half way. It was conveniently located three or four blocks off the 
				Welland Canal bike trail and very close to the waterfront trail. Our accommodations were impeccably 
				clean and comfortable. Our host was very nice. He recommended a local restaurant (which was excellent) 
				and even drove us there. There was a safe place to put our bikes and the surrounding neighborhood was 
				really nice. Breakfast was delicious! Overall a great stay and perfect for cyclists.&#34;
